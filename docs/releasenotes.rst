Release date: February 24, 2017

The code has been significantly restructured since the previous version, in order to increase the modularity; much of the code structure has been changed since v0.4. Specific changes below:

* A parallelization scheme allowing for fast message passing with ZeroMQ.
* A simpler database format based on files, which optionally can be compressed to save diskspace.
* Incorporation of an experimental neural network model based on google's TensorFlow package. Requires TensorFlow version 0.11.0.
* Incorporation of an experimental bootstrap module for uncertainty analysis.

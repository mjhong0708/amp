Using *Amp* Potentials for Molecular Dynamics
********************************


==================================
USING KIM/LAMMPS
==================================

Machine-learning parameters trained in *Amp* can be used to perform fast molecular dynamics simulations, via the `Knowledge Base for Interatomic Models <https://openkim.org/>`_ (KIM).
`LAMMPS <http://www.afs.enea.it/software/lammps/doc17/html/Section_packages.html#kim>`_ recognizes *kim* as a pair style that interfaces with the KIM repository of interatomic potentials.

To build LAMMPS with the KIM package you must first install the KIM API (library) on your system.
Below are the minimal steps you need in order to install the KIM API.
After KIM API is installed, you will need to install LAMMMPS from its `github repository <https://github.com/lammps/lammps>`_.
Finally we will need to install the model driver that is provided in the *Amp* repository.
In the followings we discuss each of these steps.

In this installation instruction, we assume that the following requirements are installed on your system:

* git
* make
* cmake (If it is not installed on your system see `here <https://cmake.org/install/>`_.)
* GNU compilers (gcc, g++, gfortran) version 4.8.x or higher.


----------------------------------
Installation of KIM API
----------------------------------

You can follow the instructions given at the OpenKIM `github repository <https://github.com/openkim/kim-api/blob/master/INSTALL>`_ to install KIM API.
In short, you need to clone the repository by::

   $ git clone https://github.com/openkim/kim-api.git

Next do the following::

   $ cd kim-api-master && mkdir build && cd build
   $ FC=gfortran-4.8 cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   $ make
   $ sudo make install
   $ sudo ldconfig

The second line forces cmake to use gfortran-4.8 as the fortran compiler.
We saw gfortran-5 throws error "Error: TS 29113/TS 18508: Noninteroperable array" but gfortran-4.8 should work fine.
Now you can list model and model drivers available in KIM API by::

   $ kim-api-collections-management list

or install and remove models and model drivers, etc.
For a detailed explanation of possible options see `here <https://openkim.org/kim-api/>`_.


----------------------------------
Building LAMMPS
----------------------------------

Clone LAMMPS source files from the `github repository <https://github.com/lammps/lammps>`_::

   $ git clone https://github.com/lammps/lammps.git

Now you can do the following to build LAMMPS::

   $ cd lammps && mkdir build && cd build
   $ cmake -D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=gcc -D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=g++ -D CMAKE_Fortran_COMPILER=gfortran -D PKG_KIM=on -D KIM_LIBRARY=$"/usr/local/lib/libkim-api.so" -D KIM_INCLUDE_DIR=$"/usr/local/include/kim-api" ../cmake
   $ make


----------------------------------
Installation of *amp_model_driver*
----------------------------------

Now you are ready to install the *amp_model_driver* provided on this repository.
To do that first change to *amp-kim* directory by::

   $ cd /amp_directory/amp/tools/amp-kim/

where *amp_directory* is where your *Amp* source files are located.

Then make a copy of the fortran modules inside the *amp_model_driver* directory by::

   $ cp ../../amp/descriptor/gaussian.f90 amp_model_driver/gaussian.F90
   $ cp ../../amp/descriptor/cutoffs.f90 amp_model_driver/cutoffs.F90
   $ cp ../../amp/model/neuralnetwork.f90 amp_model_driver/neuralnetwork.F90

Finally you can install the *amp_model_driver* by::

   $ kim-api-collections-management install user ./amp_model_driver

You can now remove the fortran modules that you copied earlier::

   $ rm amp_model_driver/gaussian.F90
   $ rm amp_model_driver/cutoffs.F90
   $ rm amp_model_driver/neuralnetwork.F90


----------------------------------
Installation of *amp_parametrized_model*
----------------------------------

Now that you have *amp_model_driver* installed, you need to install the parameters also as the final step.
**Note that this is the only step that you need to repeat when you change the parameters of the machine-learning model.**
You should first parse all of the parameters of your *Amp* calculator to a text file by:

.. code-block:: python

   from amp import Amp
   from amp.convert import save_to_openkim
   
   calc = Amp(...)
   calc.train(...)
   save_to_openkim(calc)

where the last line parses the parameters of the calc object into a text file called *amp.params*.

You should then copy the generated text file into the *amp_parameterized_model* sub-directory of the *Amp* source directory::

   $ cp /working_directory/amp.params amp_directory/amp/tools/amp-kim/amp_parameterized_model/.

where *working_directory* is where *amp.params* is located initially, and *amp_directory* is the directory of the *Amp* source files.
Finally you change back to the *amp-kim* directory by::

   $ cd /amp_directory/amp/tools/amp-kim/

Note that installation of *amp_parameterized_model* will not work without *amp.params* being located in the */amp_directory/amp/tools/amp-kim/amp_parameterized_model* directory.
Next install your parameters by::

   $ kim-api-collections-management install user ./amp_parameterized_model

Congrats!
Now you are ready to use the *Amp* calculator with *amp.params* in you molecular dynamics simulation by an input file like this:

.. code-block:: bash

   variable       x index 1
   variable       y index 1
   variable       z index 1

   variable       xx equal 10*$x
   variable       yy equal 10*$y
   variable       zz equal 10*$z
   
   units          metal
   atom_style     atomic

   lattice        fcc 3.5
   region         box block 0 ${xx} 0 ${yy} 0 ${zz}
   create_box     1 box
   create_atoms   1 box
   mass           1 1.0
   
   velocity       all create 1.44 87287 loop geom
   
   pair_style     kim amp_parameterized_model
   pair_coeff     * * Pd
   
   neighbor       0.3 bin
   neigh_modify   delay 0 every 20 check no
   
   fix            1 all nve
   
   run            10

which, for example, is an input script for LAMMPS to do a molecular dynamics simulation of a Pd system for 10 units of time.


==================================
USING PROPhet/LAMMPS
==================================

This is a guide for compiling the neural network code `PROPhet <https://github.com/biklooost/PROPhet/>`_ and linking it to the `LAMMPS <https://github.com/lammps/lammps>`_ package.
This can be used for doing fast force and energy evaluations for neural network potentials trained with the `AMP <https://bitbucket.org/andrewpeterson/amp/src/master/amp>`_ code.


----------------------------------
Installation of PROPhet/LAMMPS
----------------------------------

Create a folder, where everything will be stored called e.g. LAMPHET and go into it::

   $ mkdir LAMPHET
   $ cd LAMPHET

Download latest stable LAMMPS version into the LAMPHET directory::

   $ git clone https://github.com/lammps/lammps.git

Download the following version of the `PROPhet <https://github.com/Augustegm/PROPhet>`_ code. 
Then change to the amp compatible branch::

   $ git clone https://github.com/Augustegm/PROPhet.git
   $ cd PROPhet
   $ git checkout amp_compatible

Now we need to set the following environment variables in our .bashrc::

   $ export LAMPHET=path_to_your_codes/LAMPHET
   $ export PROPhet_DIR=$LAMPHET/PROPhet/src
   $ export LAMMPS_DIR=$LAMPHET/lammps/src 
   $ export PATH=$PATH:$LAMMPS_DIR
   $ export PYTHONPATH=$LAMPHET/lammps/python:$PYTHONPATH
   $ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LAMPHET/lammps/src

The next step is to compile PROPhet. To do this correctly, you will need to first write the makefile and manually edit it::

   $ cd $PROPhet_DIR
   $ ./configure --prefix=$LAMPHET/prophet-install --enable-lammps=$LAMMPS_DIR

Edit line 8 in the Makefile to include the -fPIC option::

   $ CFLAGS =-O3 -DUSE_MPI -fPIC

Now build PROPhet by typing::

   $ make

The next step is to compile LAMMPS. To do this we first need to copy over a file from PROPhet::

   $ cd $LAMMPS_DIR
   $ cp $PROPhet_DIR/pair_nn.h .

We also need to change some lines in the Makefile.package.empty file. Edit lines 4-6 to::

   $ PKG_INC = -I$(PROPhet_DIR)
   $ PKG_PATH = -L$(PROPhet_DIR)
   $ PKG_LIB = -lPROPhet_lammps

Now we can compile LAMMPS. It is recommended to compile it in the four different ways
giving a serial and parallel version as well as shared library versions, which are needed if one
wants to use it from Python (needed for using the LAMMPS interface in ASE)::
   $ make serial
   $ make mpi
   $ make serial mode=shlib
   $ make mpi mode=shlib

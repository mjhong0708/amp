Amp: Atomistic Machine-learning Package
=======================================

`Amp <https://bitbucket.org/andrewpeterson/amp>`_ is an open-source package designed to easily bring machine-learning to atomistic calculations.
This project is being developed at Brown University in the School of Engineering, primarily by **Andrew Peterson** and **Alireza Khorshidi**,
and is released under the GNU General Public License.

This is a relatively new project, so things are constantly changing!
Please see the project's `git repository <https://bitbucket.org/andrewpeterson/amp>`_ for the latest version and news.

You can read about Amp in the below paper; if you find Amp useful, we would appreciate if you cite this work:

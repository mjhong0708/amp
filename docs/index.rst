Amp: Atomistic Machine-learning Package
=======================================

Amp is an open-source package designed to easily bring machine-learning to atomistic calculations.
This project is being developed at Brown University in the School of Engineering, primarily by **Andrew Peterson** and **Alireza Khorshidi**, and is released under the GNU General Public License.

The latest stable release of Amp is version 0.6, released on July 31, 2017; see the :ref:`ReleaseNotes` page for a download link.
Please see the project's `git repository <https://bitbucket.org/andrewpeterson/amp>`_ for the latest development version or a place to report an issue.
